##**Assumptions**

This lab manual assumes that you are attending an instructor-led lab at Red Hat Summit and that you will be using this lab manual in conjunction with the lecture.  

This manual also assumes that you have been granted access to three Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual servers with which to perform the exercises in it.  If you do not have access to your servers, please notify the instructor.

A working knowledge of SSH, Git, and Yum and familiarity with a Linux-based text editor are assumed.  If you do not have an understanding of any of these technologies, please let the instructor know.

##**What you can expect to learn from this lab**

At the conclusion of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of how to install and configure OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.  You should also feel comfortable creating and deploying applications using the OpenShift Enterprise management console, using the OpenShift Enterprise administration console, using command-line tools, and managing the application lifecycle.

##**Overview of OpenShift Enterprise PaaS**

Platform as a Service is changing the way developers approach developing software. A developer typically uses a local sandbox with his or her preferred application server and only deploys locally on that instance. Developers typically start JBoss locally using the *startup.sh* command and drop their *.war* or *.ear* files into the deployment directory, and they are done.  Developers have a hard time understanding why deploying to the production infrastructure is such a time-consuming process.

System administrators understand the complexity of not only deploying the code, but procuring, provisioning, and maintaining a production-level system. They need to stay up to date on the latest security patches and errata, ensure the firewall is properly configured, maintain a consistent and reliable backup and restore plan, monitor the application and servers for CPU load, disk IO, HTTP requests, etc.

OpenShift Enterprise provides developers and IT organizations an auto-scaling cloud application platform for quickly deploying new applications on secure and scalable resources with minimal configuration and management headaches. This means increased developer productivity and a faster pace with which IT can support innovation.

This manual will walk you through the process of installing and configuring an OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 environment as part of this training class that you are attending.

##**Overview of IaaS**

One great thing about OpenShift Enterprise is that we are infrastructure agnostic. You can run OpenShift on bare metal, on virtualized instances, or on public/private cloud instances. The only thing that is required is Red Hat Enterprise Linux running on x86_64 architecture. We require Red Hat Enterprise Linux in order to take advantage of SELinux and other enterprise features so that you can ensure your installation is stable and secure.

What does this mean? This means that in order to take advantage of OpenShift Enterprise, you can use any existing resources that you have in your hardware pool today. It doesn't matter if your infrastructure is based on EC2, VMware, RHEV, Rackspace, OpenStack, CloudStack, or even bare metal, as we run on top of any Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system running on x86_64.

For this training class, we will be using OpenStack as our Infrastructure as a Service layer.

##**Deploying OpenShift Enterprise**

In this lab, we are going to take advantage of the *openshift.sh* installation script, which automates the deployment and initial configuration of the OpenShift Enterprise platform.  However, for a deeper understanding of the internals of the platform, it is suggested that you read through the official [Deployment Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html-single/Deployment_Guide/index.html) for OpenShift Enterprise.

##**Electronic version of this document**

This lab manual contains many configuration items that will need to be performed on your broker and node hosts.  Manually typing in all of these values would be a tedious and error-prone effort.  To alleviate the risk of errors, and to let you concentrate on learning the material instead of typing tedious configuration items, an electronic version of the document is provided on your virtual servers.

#**Lab 2: Installing OpenShift Enterprise 2.0**

**Server used:**

* broker host

**Tools used:**

* *openshift.sh*

##**Overview of *openshift.sh***

The OpenShift team has developed an installation script for the platform that simplifies the installation and configuration of the PaaS.  The *openshift.sh* script is a flexible tool to get an environment up and running quickly, without having to worry about manually configuring all of the required services.  For a better understanding of how the tool works, it is suggested that you view the source code of *openshift.sh* to become familiar with the configuration involved in setting up the platform.  For this training class, once the installation of the PaaS has started, the instructor will go over the architecture of the PaaS to get you familiar with all of the components and their respective purposes.

A copy of *openshift.sh* has already been loaded on each system provided to you.  This script is also available in the [enterprise-2.0 branch of the openshift-extras Github repository](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/tree/enterprise-2.0).  In that repository, you can find a [kickstart version](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/enterprise-2.0/enterprise/install-scripts/openshift.ks) of the script as well as other versions.  The script we will be using is the [generic openshift.sh](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/enterprise-2.0/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh) script.

##**Installing and configuring the OpenShift broker host**

The *openshift.sh* script takes arguments, in the form of environment variables or command-line arguments, to specify settings for the script.  All of the recognized settings are documented extensively in comments at the top of the script.  For our purposes, we will want to specify the following settings when we use this script to install the broker host:

* *install_components=broker,named,activemq,datastore*
* *domain=apps.example.com*
* *hosts_domain=hosts.example.com*
* *broker_hostname=broker.hosts.example.com*
* *named_entries=broker:{host1 IP address},activemq:{host1 IP address},datastore:{host1 IP address},node:{host2 IP address}*

Let's go over each of these options in more detail.

### *install_components* setting ###

The *install_components* setting specifies which components the script will install and configure.  In this training session, we will install the OpenShift broker component and supporting services on which OpenShift depends on one host, and we will install the OpenShift node component on a second host.

In more complex installations, you will want to install each component on a separate host (in fact, you will want to install most components on several hosts each for redundancy).  For testing or POCs, you may want to install all components (including both the OpenShift broker and node) on a single host, which is the default if you do not specify a setting for *install_components*.

### *domain* and *host_domain* settings ###

The *domain* setting specifies the domain name that you would like to use for your applications that will be hosted on the OpenShift Enterprise platform.  The default is example.com, but it makes more sense from an architecture view point to separate these out to their own domain, which we will do in this lab, using the apps.example.com domain.

The *hosts_domain* setting specifies the domain name that you would like the OpenShift infrastructure hosts to use, which includes the OpenShift broker and node hosts.  This domain also includes hosts running supporting services, such as ActiveMQ and MongoDB, although in our case, we are running these services on the same host as the OpenShift broker component.

While it is not required to do so, it is good practice to put your infrastructure hosts (broker and nodes) under a separate domain from applications, and we will follow this practice in this lab, using the hosts.example.com domain.

### *broker_hostname* setting ###

The *broker_hostname* setting specifies the fully-qualified hostname that the installation script will configure for the OpenShift broker host.  In a more complex configuration with redundant brokers, you will want to use this setting to specify a unique hostname for each host that you install (e.g., *broker_hostname=broker01.hosts.example.com* on the first OpenShift broker host, *broker_hostname=broker02.hosts.example.com* on the second OpenShift broker host, and so on).  For this training session, we will only be installing one broker host.

### *named_entries* setting ###

The *named_entries* setting is used when the script installs the nameserver to add DNS records for the various hosts and services we will be installing.

Because we are telling *openshift.sh* to install a nameserver alongside the OpenShift broker, the script will automatically configure the host to use itself as its own nameserver.  If we were not installing the nameserver on the broker host, we would need to tell *openshift.sh* what nameserver to use using an additional setting (we will use this additional setting, the *named_ip_addr*, when we configure our second host as an OpenShift node host).

### Executing *openshift.sh* ###

Let's go ahead and execute the command to run installation script.

For own use, set the *host1* and *host2* environment variables:

**Note:** Execute the following command on the broker host.

	host1=172.16.1.2; host2=172.16.1.3

Next, for *openshift.sh*, set the following environment variables:

**Note:** Perform the following command on the broker host.

	export CONF_INSTALL_COMPONENTS=broker,named,activemq,datastore
	export CONF_DOMAIN=apps.example.com
	export CONF_HOSTS_DOMAIN=hosts.example.com
	export CONF_BROKER_HOSTNAME=broker.hosts.example.com
	export CONF_NAMED_ENTRIES=broker:$host1,activemq:$host1,datastore:$host1,node:$host2

While we could use the corresponding command-line arguments to specify these settings, we will use environment variables to force ourselves to be careful.  After setting the above variables, run the following command and verify that the variables have all been set as described above and have IP addresses substituted appropriately:

	env | grep CONF_

**Note:** Verify that the settings are correct.

Now let's execute *openshift.sh*.  Note that we will use the *tee* command to make an installation log.

**Note:** Perform the following command on the broker host.

	sh openshift.sh |& tee broker-install.log

While the installation script runs on the OpenShift broker host, open a console for your node host, and continue on to the next section to begin the installation and configuration of this host.

##**Installing and configuring the OpenShift node host**

To install and configure the OpenShift node host, we will want to specify the following settings to *openshift.sh*:

* *install_components=node*
* *domain=apps.example.com*
* *hosts_domain=hosts.example.com*
* *named_ip_addr={host1 IP address}*
* *node_hostname=node.hosts.example.com*

Following is an explanation for each of these arguments.

### *install_components* setting ###

We will specify the *install_components* setting for this host to configure it as an OpenShift node host.

### *domain* and *host_domain* settings ###

We described the *domain* and *hosts_domain* settings earlier in this lab while installing and configuring the OpenShift broker host.

### *named_ip_addr* setting ###

For the *named_ip_addr* setting, we will use the address for *host1*. We use the *named_ip_addr* setting to configure name resolution on the OpenShift node host to use our own nameserver.

### *node_hostname* setting ###

The *node_hostname* setting specifies the fully-qualified hostname that the installation script will configure for the OpenShift node host.

### Executing *openshift.sh* ###

Before we execute the command to run installation script, let's set the *host1* and *host2* environment variables as we did on the broker host:

**Note:** Perform the following command on the node host.

	host1=172.16.1.2; host2=172.16.1.3

Next, set the following environment variables:

	export CONF_INSTALL_COMPONENTS=node
	export CONF_DOMAIN=apps.example.com
	export CONF_HOSTS_DOMAIN=hosts.example.com
	export CONF_NAMED_IP_ADDR=$host1
	export CONF_NODE_HOSTNAME=node.hosts.example.com

Run the following command and verify that the settings are correct and have the appropriate IP addresses substituted:

	env | grep CONF_

**Note:** Verify that the settings are correct.

Now launch the installation script:

	sh openshift.sh |& tee node-install.log

Allow the installation script to run.  During this time, the instructor will lecture about the architecture of OpenShift Enterprise.

#**Lab 3: Verifying the installation**

**Server used:**

* broker host

**Tools used:**

* *cat*
* *ping*
* *oo-diagnositcs*
* *oo-mco* 
* *mongo*
* *shutdown*
	
##**Rebooting the hosts**

Congratulations! You have just installed OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.  However, before proceeding any further in the lab manual, we need to verify that the installation was successful.  There are a couple of utilities that we can use to help with this task.  The first thing we want to check is that everything was installed and configured correctly to ensure that all services will be present after a reboot of the hosts.  To ensure that all services are started in the correct order, reboot the broker host first by going to the console of your broker host and entering in the following command:

**Note:** Perform the following command on the broker host.

	shutdown -r now

Wait for the system to restart.  Once the broker host has finished rebooting, it is safe to reboot the node host.  Go to the console of your node host and enter in the following command:

**Note:** Perform the following command on the node host.

	shutdown -r now
	
Wait for your node host to come back online.

##**Verifying the installation**

###**Verifying DNS nameserver**
Now that our broker and node hosts have been restarted, we can verify that some of the core services have started upon system boot.  The first one want to test is the named service, provided by *BIND*.  In order to test that *BIND* was started successfully, enter in the following command:

	service named status
	
You should see information similar to the following:

	version: 9.8.2rc1-RedHat-9.8.2-0.17.rc1.el6_4.6
	CPUs found: 2
	worker threads: 2
	number of zones: 8
	debug level: 0
	xfers running: 0
	xfers deferred: 0
	soa queries in progress: 0
	query logging is OFF
	recursive clients: 0/0/1000
	tcp clients: 0/100
	server is up and running
	named (pid  1106) is running...

If *BIND* is up and running, we can feel assured that there are no syntax errors in our zone files.

The next aspect of DNS that we can verify is the actual database for our DNS records.  There should be two database files that contain the domain information for our hosts.  Let's verify that the DNS information for our hosts.example.com zone has been setup correctly with the following command:

	cat /var/named/dynamic/hosts.example.com.db

The output should look similar to the following.

	$ORIGIN .
	$TTL 1	; 1 seconds (for testing only)
	hosts.example.com		IN SOA	broker.hosts.example.com. hostmaster.hosts.example.com. (
					2011112904 ; serial
					60         ; refresh (1 minute)
					15         ; retry (15 seconds)
					1800       ; expire (30 minutes)
					10         ; minimum (10 seconds)
					)
				NS	broker.hosts.example.com.
				MX	10 mail.hosts.example.com.
	$ORIGIN hosts.example.com.
	broker			A	172.16.1.2
	activemq			A	172.16.1.2
	datastore			A	172.16.1.2
	node			A	172.16.1.3

Verify that you have entries for both the broker and the node host listed in the output of the *cat* command.  Once you have verified this, take a look at the database for the apps.example.com zone to verify that is has an *NS* entry for *broker.hosts.example.com*:

	cat /var/named/dynamic/apps.example.com.db

###**Verifying DNS resolution**

One of the most common problems that students encounter is improper host name resolution.  If this problem occurs, the broker will not be able to contact the node hosts and vice versa.  Both the broker and node host should be using your OpenShift broker host at 172.16.1.2 for DNS resolution.  To verify this, view the */etc/resolv.conf* file on both the broker and node host to verify it is pointed to the correct *BIND* server.

	cat /etc/resolv.conf

If everything with DNS is setup correctly, you should be able to ping node.hosts.example.com from the broker and receive a response, as shown below.

	ping node.hosts.example.com
	
 	PING node.hosts.example.com (209.132.178.69) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from node.osop-local (209.132.178.69): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.502 ms

###**Verifying ActiveMQ and MCollective**	

ActiveMQ is a fully open-source message service that is available for use across many different programming languages and environments.  MCollective is a higher-level framework for remote job execution that communicates over ActiveMQ.  OpenShift Enterprise makes use of these technologies to handle communications between the broker host and the node host in our deployment.

The first thing we want to ensure is that the ActiveMQ daemon is running.  Perform the following command on the broker host:

**Note:** Execute this command on the broker host

	service activemq status

The output of the above command should look similar to the following:

	ActiveMQ Broker is running (1211).

Now that we know that ActiveMQ is up and running, let's verify that MCollective is able to communicate between the broker and the node hosts.  To verify this, use the *oo-mco ping* command.

**Note:** Execute the following on the broker host

	oo-mco ping

If MCollective is working correctly, you should see the following output (the time values will vary).

	node.hosts.example.com                  time=114.73 ms
	
	
	---- ping statistics ----
	1 replies max: 114.73 min: 114.73 avg: 114.73


###**Using the *oo-diagnostics* utility**	

OpenShift Enterprise ships with a diagnostics utility that can check the health and state of your installation.  The utility may take a few minutes to run as it inspects your hosts.  In order to run this tool, simply enter the following command:
	
**Note:** Execute the following on the broker host

	oo-diagnostics
	
When running the *oo-diagnostics* script at this time, it is expected to see some warnings as we have not yet setup districts for our installation.  You may also see an error regarding the verification of the security certificate.

#**Lab 4: Managing resources**

**Server used:**

* node host
* broker host

**Tools used:**

* text editor
* *oo-admin-ctl-user*

##**Setting default gear quotas and sizes**

A user's default gear size and quota are specified in the */etc/openshift/broker.conf* configuration file located on the broker host.

The *VALID_GEAR_SIZES* setting is not applied to users but rather specifies the gear sizes that the current OpenShift Enterprise PaaS installation supports.

The *DEFAULT_MAX_GEARS* setting specifies the number of gears to assign to a new user upon that user's creation.  This is the total number of gears that a user can create by default.

The *DEFAULT_GEAR_SIZE* setting is the default size for gears when the user creates a new application.

The *DEFAULT_MAX_DOMAINS* setting specifies the max number of domains that one user can create.

Take a look at the  */etc/openshift/broker.conf* configuration file to determine the current settings for your installation:

**Note:** Execute the following on the broker host.

	cat /etc/openshift/broker.conf

By default, OpenShift Enterprise sets the default gear size to small, the number of gears a user can create to 100, and the maximum number of domains to 10.

When changing the */etc/openshift/broker.conf* configuration file, keep in mind that the existing settings are cached until you restart the *openshift-broker* service.

##**Setting the number of gears a specific user can create**

There are often times when you want to increase or decrease the number of gears a particular user can consume without modifying the setting for all existing users.  OpenShift Enterprise provides a command that allows the administrator to configure settings for an individual user.  To see all of the available actions that can be performed on a specific user, enter the following command:

	oo-admin-ctl-user

To see how many gears our *demo* user has consumed as well as how many gears the *demo* user has access to create, you can provide the following switch to the *oo-admin-ctl-user* command:

	oo-admin-ctl-user -l demo

Given the current state of our configuration for this training class, you should see the following output:

	User demo:
	    consumed gears: 0
	    max gears: 100
	    gear sizes: small

In order to change the number of gears that our *demo* user has permission to create, you can pass the `--setmaxgears` switch to the command.  For instance, if we only want to allow the *demo* user to be able to create 25 gears, we would use the following command:

	oo-admin-ctl-user -l demo --setmaxgears 25

After entering the above command, you should see the following output:

 	Setting max_gears to 25... Done.
 	User demo:
 	  consumed gears: 0
 	  max gears: 25
 	  gear sizes: small


##**Defining new gear types**

Each OpenShift node can only have one gear size associated with it.  When referring to the gear size associated with a particular node, we use the term "node profile." In order to add new gear sizes to your OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 installation, you will need to do two things:

* Create and define the new node profile on the node host.
* Update the list of valid node profiles (gear sizes) on the broker host.

To define a new gear size (node profile) in a multi-node setup, you would edit the */etc/openshift/broker.conf* file on each broker host to specify the allowed gear sizes and then modify the node profile in the */etc/openshift/resource_limits.conf* file on each node that you would like to host that gear size to match the name and sizing you would like.

##**Setting the type of gears a specific user can create**

**Note:** The below information is for informational purposes only.  During this lab, we are only working with one node host and therefore cannot add additional gear sizes.

In a production environment, a customer will typically have different gear sizes that are available for developers to consume.  For this lab, we will only create small gears.  However, to add the ability to create medium size gears for the *demo* user, you can pass the `--addgearsize` switch to the *oo-admin-ctl-user* command:

	oo-admin-ctl-user -l demo --addgearsize medium

After entering the above command, you would see the following output:

	Adding gear size medium for user demo... Done.
	User demo:
	  consumed gears: 0
	  max gears: 25
	  gear sizes: small, medium

In order to remove the ability for a user to create a specific gear size, you can use the `--removegearsize` switch:

	oo-admin-ctl-user -l demo --removegearsize medium

#**Lab 5: Managing districts**

**Server used:**

* node host
* broker host

**Tools used:**

* text editor
* *oo-admin-ctl-district*

Districts define a set of node hosts within which gears can be easily moved to load-balance the resource usage of those nodes. While not required for a proof-of-concept OpenShift Enterprise installation, districts provide several administrative benefits, and their use is essentially required in production.

Districts allow a gear to maintain the same UUID (and related IP addresses, MCS levels, and ports) across any node within the district, so that applications continue to function normally when moved between nodes in the same district. All nodes within a district have the same profile, meaning that all the gears on those nodes are the same size (for example, small or medium). There is a hard limit of 6000 gears per district.

This means, for example, that developers who hard-code environment settings into their applications instead of using environment variables will not experience problems due to gear migrations between nodes. Applications will continue to function normally because exactly the same environment is reserved for each gear on every node in the district. This saves developers and administrators time and effort.

##**Enabling districts**

To use districts, the broker's MCollective plugin must be configured to enable districts.  Edit the */etc/openshift/plugins.d/openshift-origin-msg-broker-mcollective.conf* configuration file and confirm the following parameters are set:

**Note: Confirm the following on the broker host.**

	DISTRICTS_ENABLED=true
	NODE_PROFILE_ENABLED=true
	
While you are viewing this file, you may notice the *DISTRICTS_REQUIRE_FOR_APP_CREATE=false* setting.  Enabling this option prevents users from creating a new application if there are no districts defined or if all districts are at max capacity.

##**Creating and populating districts**

To create a district that will support a gear type of small, we will use the *oo-admin-ctl-district* command.  After defining the district, we can add our node host (node.hosts.example.com) as the only node in that district.  Execute the following commands to create a district named "small_district" which can only hold *small* gear types:

**Note: Execute the following on the broker host.**

	oo-admin-ctl-district -c create -n small_district -p small

If the command was successful, you should see output similar to the following:

	Successfully created district: 513b50508f9f44aeb90090f19d2fd940
	
	{"name"=>"small_district",
	 "externally_reserved_uids_size"=>0,
	 "active_server_identities_size"=>0,
	 "node_profile"=>"small",
	 "max_uid"=>6999,
	 "creation_time"=>"2013-01-15T17:18:28-05:00",
	 "max_capacity"=>6000,
	 "server_identities"=>{},
	 "uuid"=>"513b50508f9f44aeb90090f19d2fd940",
	 "available_uids"=>"<6000 uids hidden>",
	 "available_capacity"=>6000}

If you are familiar with JSON, you will understand the format of this output.  What actually happened is a new document was created in the MongoDB database that we installed using the *openshift.sh* installation script.  To view this document inside of the database, execute the following command on the broker host:

	mongo localhost/openshift_broker -u openshift -p mongopass

**Note:** The default MongoDB username and password can be found in the */etc/openshift/broker.conf* file.

This will drop you into the mongo shell where you can perform commands against the database.  The first thing we need to do is list all of the available collections in the *openshift_broker* database.  To do so, you can issue the following command:

	db.getCollectionNames()
	
You should see the following collections returned:

	[
		"applications",
		"authorizations",
		"cloud_users",
		"districts",
		"domains",
		"locks",
		"system.indexes",
		"system.users",
		"usage",
		"usage_records"
	]	

We can now query the *district* collection to verify the creation of our small district:

	db.districts.find()
	
The output should be the following:

	{ "_id" : "513b50508f9f44aeb90090f19d2fd940", "name" : "small_district", "externally_reserved_uids_size" : 0, 
	"active_server_identities_size" : 0, "node_profile" : "small", "max_uid" : 6999, "creation_time" : 
	"2013-01-15T17:18:28-05:00", "max_capacity" : 6000, "server_identities" : [ ], "uuid" : 
	"513b50508f9f44aeb90090f19d2fd940", "available_uids" : [ 	1000, .........], , "available_capacity" : 6000 }

**Note:** The *server_identities* array does not contain any data yet.

**Note:** The above output is an abbreviated version.  You will see more information returned from the command.  The order is not set as this is a JSON document.

Exit the mongo shell by using the exit command:

	exit

Now we can add our node host, node.hosts.example.com, to the *small_district* that we created above:

	oo-admin-ctl-district -c add-node -n small_district -i node.hosts.example.com

You should see the following output:

	Success!
	
	{"available_capacity"=>6000,
	 "creation_time"=>"2013-01-15T17:18:28-05:00",
	 "available_uids"=>"<6000 uids hidden>",
	 "node_profile"=>"small",
	 "uuid"=>"513b50508f9f44aeb90090f19d2fd940",
	 "externally_reserved_uids_size"=>0,
	 "server_identities"=>{"node.hosts.example.com"=>{"active"=>true}},
	 "name"=>"small_district",
	 "max_capacity"=>6000,
	 "max_uid"=>6999,
	 "active_server_identities_size"=>1}

**Note:** If you see an error message indicating that you can't add this node to the district because the node already has applications on it, congratulations -- you worked ahead and have already created an application. To clean this up, you will need to delete both your application and domain that you created.  If you don't know how to do this, ask the instructor.

In order to verify that the information was added to the MongoDB document, enter in the following commands:

	mongo localhost/openshift_broker -u openshift -p mongopass
	db.districts.find()

You should see the following information in the *server_identities* array.

	"server_identities" : [ { "name" : "node.hosts.example.com", "active" : true } ]

If you continued to add additional nodes to this district, the *server_identities* array would show all the node hosts assigned to the district.

OpenShift Enterprise also provides a command-line tool to display information about a district.  Simply enter the following command to view the JSON information that is stored in the MongoDB database:

	oo-admin-ctl-district

Once you enter the above command, you should see a more human readable version of the document:

	{"_id"=>"52afc6ed3a0fb2e386000001",
	 "active_server_identities_size"=>1,
	 "available_capacity"=>6000,
	 "available_uids"=>"<6000 uids hidden>",
	 "created_at"=>2013-12-17 03:37:17 UTC,
	 "gear_size"=>"small",
	 "max_capacity"=>6000,
	 "max_uid"=>6999,
	 "name"=>"small_district",
	 "server_identities"=>[{"name"=>"broker.hosts.example.com", "active"=>true}],
	 "updated_at"=>2013-12-17 03:45:35 UTC,
	 "uuid"=>"52afc6ed3a0fb2e386000001"}

##**Managing district capacity**

Districts and node hosts have a configured capacity for the number of gears allowed. For a node host, the default value configured in */etc/openshift/resource_limits.conf* is the following: 

* Maximum number of active gears per node: 100	

Use the *max_active_gears* parameter in the */etc/openshift/resource_limits.conf* file to specify the maximum number of active gears allowed per node. By default, this value is set to 100, but most administrators will need to modify this value over time. Stopped or idled gears do not count toward this limit; a node can have any number of inactive gears, constrained only by storage. However, starting inactive gears after the *max_active_gears* limit has been reached may exceed the limit, which cannot be prevented or corrected. Reaching the limit exempts the node from future gear placement by the broker.

##**Viewing district capacity statistics**

In order view usage information for your installation, you can use the *oo-stats* command.  Let's view the current state of our district by entering the following command:

	oo-stats

You should see information similar to the following:

	------------------------
	Profile 'small' summary:

#**Lab 6: Configuring RHC**

**Server used:**

* client host

**Tools used:**

* *rhc*

##**Using *rhc setup***

By default, the RHC command-line tool will default to using the publicly hosted OpenShift environment (http://www.openshift.com).  Since we are using our own enterprise environment, we need to tell *rhc* to use our broker.hosts.example.com server instead of openshift.com.  In order to accomplish this, the first thing we need to do is run the *rhc setup* command using the optional `--server` parameter.

	rhc setup --server broker.hosts.example.com

Once you enter in that command, you will be prompted for the username that you would like to authenticate with.  For this training class, use the *demo* user account.  The password configured for this account is *changeme*.

The first thing that you will be prompted with will look like the following:

	The server's certificate is self-signed, which means that a secure connection can't be established to
	'broker.hosts.example.com'.
	
	You may bypass this check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
	Connect without checking the certificate? (yes|no):

Since we are using a self-signed certificate, go ahead and select *yes* here and press the enter key.

At this point, you will be prompted for the username.  Enter in *demo* and specify the password for the *demo* user.

After authenticating, OpenShift Enterprise will prompt if you want to create a authentication token for your system.  This will allow you to execute command on the PaaS as a developer without having to authenticate.  It is suggested that you generate a token to speed up the other labs in this training class.

The next step in the setup process is to create and upload our SSH key to the broker server.  This is required for pushing your source code, via Git, up to the OpenShift Enterprise PaaS.

Finally, you will be asked to create a namespace for the provided user account.  The namespace is a unique name which becomes part of your application's URL. It is also commonly referred to as the user's domain. The namespace can be at most 16 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters. For this lab, create the following namespace:

	ose

##**Under the covers**

The *rhc setup* tool is a convenient command-line utility to ensure that the user's operating system is configured properly to create and manage applications from the command line.  After this command has been executed, a *.openshift/* directory will have been created in the user's home directory with some basic configuration items specified in the *express.conf* file.  The contents of that file are as follows:

	# Default user login
	default_rhlogin='demo'

	# Server API
	libra_server = 'broker.hosts.example.com'

This information will be read by the *rhc* command line tool for every future command that is issued.  If you want to run commands as a different user than the one listed above, you can either change the default login in this file or provide the `-l` switch to the *rhc* command.


**Lab 6 Complete!**

#**Lab 7: Creating a PHP application**

**Server used:**

* client host
* node host

**Tools used:**

* *rhc*

In this lab, we are ready to start using OpenShift Enterprise to create our first application.  To create an application, we will be using the *rhc app* command.  In order to view all of the switches available for the *rhc app* command, enter the following command:

	rhc app -h

This will provide you with the following output:

	List of Actions
	  configure     Configure several properties that apply to an application
	  create        Create an application
	  delete        Delete an application from the server
	  deploy        Deploy a git reference or binary file of an application
	  force-stop    Stops all application processes
	  reload        Reload the application's configuration
	  restart       Restart the application
	  show          Show information about an application
	  start         Start the application
	  stop          Stop the application
	  tidy          Clean out the application's logs and tmp directories and tidy up the git repo on the
	                server


##**Creating a new application**

It is very easy to create an OpenShift Enterprise application using *rhc*. The command to create an application is *rhc app create*, and it requires two mandatory arguments:

* **Application Name**: The name of the application. The application name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and at max contain only 32 characters.

* **Type**: The type is used to specify which language runtime to use.

Create a directory on your client virtual machine to hold your OpenShift Enterprise code projects, run the following commands:

	cd ~
	mkdir ose
	cd ose

To create an application that uses the *php* runtime, issue the following command:

	rhc app create firstphp php-5.3

After entering that command, you should see the following output:

	Application Options
	-------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Cartridges: php-5.3
	  Gear Size:  default
	  Scaling:    no
	
	Creating application 'firstphp' ... done
	
	
	Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done
	
	Cloning into 'firstphp'...
	The authenticity of host 'firstphp-ose.apps.example.com (209.132.178.87)' can't be established.
	RSA key fingerprint is e8:e2:6b:9d:77:e2:ed:a2:94:54:17:72:af:71:28:04.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added 'firstphp-ose.apps.example.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
	Checking connectivity... done
	
	Your application 'firstphp' is now available.
	
	  URL:        http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/
	  SSH to:     52afd7043a0fb277cf000036@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Git remote: ssh://52afd7043a0fb277cf000036@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	  Cloned to:  /Users/gshipley/code/ose/firstphp
	
	Run *rhc show-app firstphp* for more details about your app.

If you completed all of the steps in the DNS setup lab correctly, you should be able to verify that your application was created correctly by opening up a web browser and entering the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com
	
You should see the default template that OpenShift Enterprise uses for a new application:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/images/firstphp.png)

##**What just happened?**

After you entered the command to create a new PHP application, a lot of things happened under the covers:

* A request was made to the broker application host to create a new PHP application.
* A message was broadcast using MCollective and ActiveMQ to find a node host to handle the application creation request.
* A node host responded to the request and created an application/gear for you.
* A Unix user was created for your application gear.
* SELinux and cgroup policies were enabled for your application gear.
* A private Git repository was created for your gear on the node host.
* The Git repository was cloned onto your local machine.
* *BIND* was updated on the broker host to include an entry for your application.

##**Understanding the directory structure on the node host**

It is important to understand the directory structure of each OpenShift Enterprise application gear.  For the PHP application that we just created, we can verify and examine the layout of the gear on the node host.  SSH to your node host and execute the following commands:

	cd /var/lib/openshift
	ls

You will see output similar to the following:

	e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d

The above is the unique user id that was created for your application gear.  Let's examine the contents of this gear by using the following commands:

	cd e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d
	ls -al

You should see the following directories:

	total 44
	drwxr-x---.  9 root e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d 4096 Jan 21 13:47 .
	drwxr-xr-x.  5 root root                             4096 Jan 21 13:47 ..

	-rw-r--r--.  1 root root                             1352 Jan 21 13:47 .pearrc
	drwxr-xr-x. 10 root root                             4096 Jan 21 13:47 php

	[root@node e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d]# 


During a previous lab where we set up the *rhc* tool, our SSH key was uploaded to our OpenShift Enterprise PaaS to enable us to authenticate to it without having to provide a password.  The SSH key we provided was actually appended to the *authorized_keys* file.  To verify this, use the following command to view the contents of the file:

	cat .ssh/authorized_keys

You will also notice the following three directories:

* `app-root` - Contains your core application code as well as your data directory where persistent data is stored.
* `git` - Your private Git repository that was created upon gear creation.
* `php-5.3` - The core PHP runtime and associated configuration files.  Your application is served from this directory.

Let's close our SSH session and return to your local machine:

	exit


##**Understanding directory structure on the client machine**

When you created the PHP application using the *rhc app create* command, the private Git repository that was created on your node host was cloned to your local machine.

	cd firstphp
	ls -al

You should see the following information:


	total 8
	drwxr-xr-x   9 gshipley  staff   306 Jan 21 13:48 .
	drwxr-xr-x   3 gshipley  staff   102 Jan 21 13:48 ..
	drwxr-xr-x  13 gshipley  staff   442 Jan 21 13:48 .git
	drwxr-xr-x   5 gshipley  staff   170 Jan 21 13:48 .openshift

	drwxr-xr-x   4 gshipley  staff   136 Jan 21 13:48 php


###***.git/* directory**

If you are not familiar with the Git revision control system, the *.git/* directory is where information about the Git repositories that you will be interacting with is stored.  For instance, to list all of the repositories that you are currently set up to use for this project, issue the following command:

	cat .git/config

You should see the following information, which specifies the URL for our repository that is hosted on the OpenShift Enterprise node host:

	[core]
		repositoryformatversion = 0
		filemode = true
		bare = false
		logallrefupdates = true
		ignorecase = true
	[remote "origin"]
		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
		url = ssh://e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	[branch "master"]
		remote = origin
		merge = refs/heads/master
	[rhc]
		app-uuid = e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d


**Note:** You are also able to add other remote repositories.  This is useful for developers who also use Github or have private Git repositories for an existing code base.

###***.openshift/* directory**

The *.openshift/* directory is a hidden directory where a user can create action hooks, set markers, and create cron jobs.

Action hooks are scripts that are executed directly, so they can be written in Python, PHP, Ruby, shell, etc.  OpenShift Enterprise supports the following action hooks:

+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action Hook   | Description                                                                           |
+===============+=======================================================================================+
| *build*       | Executed on your CI system if available.  Otherwise, executed before the deploy step. |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *deploy*      | Executed after dependencies are resolved but before application has started.          |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *post_deploy* | Executed after application has been deployed and started.                             |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *pre_build*   | Executed on your CI system if available.  Otherwise, executed before the build step.  |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

OpenShift Enterprise also supports the ability for a user to schedule jobs to be run based upon the familiar *cron* functionality of Linux.  To enable this functionality, you need to add the cron cartridge to your application.  Once you have done so, any scripts or jobs added to the *minutely/*, *hourly/*, *daily/*, *weekly/*, or *monthly/* subdirectories under the *.openshift/cron/* directory will be run on a scheduled basis (frequency is as indicated by the name of the directory) using *run-parts*.

The *.openshift/markers/* directory will allow the user to specify settings such as enabling hot deployments or which version of Java to use.

###***libs/* directory**

The *libs/* directory is a location where the developer can provide any dependencies that are not able to be deployed using the standard dependency resolution system for the selected runtime.  In the case of PHP, the standard convention that OpenShift Enterprise uses is providing *PEAR* modules in the *deplist.txt* file.

###***misc/* directory**

The *misc/* directory is a location provided to the developer to store any application code that they do not want exposed publicly.

###***php/* directory**

The *php/* directory is where all of the application code that the developer writes should be created.  By default, two files are created in this directory:

* *health_check.php* - A simple file to determine if the application is responding to requests.
* *index.php* - The OpenShift template that we saw after application creation in the web browser.

##**Deploying updated code**

To get a good understanding of the development workflow for a user, let's change the contents of the *index.php* template that is provided on the newly created gear.  Edit the file and look for the following code block:

	<h1>
	    Welcome to OpenShift
	</h1>

Update this code block to the following and then save your changes:

	<h1>
	    Welcome to OpenShift Enterprise
	</h1>

**Note:** Make sure you are updating the `<h1>` tag and not the `<title>` tag.

Once the code has been changed, we need to commit our change to the local Git repository.  This is accomplished with the *git commit* command:

	git commit -am "Changed welcome message."

Now that our code has been committed to our local repository, we need to push those changes up to our repository that is located on the node host:

	git push

You should see the following output:

	Counting objects: 7, done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 395 bytes, done.
	Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
	remote: restart_on_add=false
	remote: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using node.example.com for ServerName
	remote: Waiting for stop to finish
	remote: Done
	remote: restart_on_add=false
	remote: ~/git/firstphp.git ~/git/firstphp.git
	remote: ~/git/firstphp.git
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/pre_build
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/build
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/deploy

	To ssh://e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d@firstphp-ose.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	   3edf63b..edc0805  master -> master


Notice that OpenShift stops the application runtime (Apache), deploys the code, and then runs any action hooks that may have been specified in the *.openshift/* directory.  

If you completed all of the steps in Lab 16 correctly, you should be able to verify that your application was deployed correctly by opening up a web browser and entering the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com

You should see the updated code for the application.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/images/firstphpOSE.png)

##**Adding a new PHP file**

Adding a new source-code file to your OpenShift Enterprise application is an easy and straightforward process.  For instance, to create a PHP source-code file that displays the server date and time, create a new file located in the *php/* directory and name it *time.php*.  After creating this file, add the following contents:

	<?php
	// Print the date and time
	echo date('l jS \of F Y h:i:s A');
	?>

Once you have saved this file, the process for pushing the changes involves adding the new file to your Git repository, committing the change, and then pushing the code to your OpenShift Enterprise gear:

	git add .
	git commit -am "Adding time.php"
	git push

To verify that we have created and deployed the new PHP source file correctly, open up a web browser and enter the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.example.com/time.php

You should see the updated code for the application:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/images/firstphpTime.png)

#**Lab 8: Managing an application**

**Server used:**

* client host
* node host

**Tools used:**

* *rhc*

## **Starting, stopping, and restarting an application**

OpenShift Enterprise provides commands to start, stop, and restart an application. If at any point in the future you decide that an application should be stopped for some maintenance, you can stop the application using the *rhc app stop* command. After making necessary maintenance tasks, you can start the application again using the *rhc app start* command.

To stop an application, execute the following command:

	rhc app stop firstphp
	
	RESULT:
	firstphp stopped

Verify that your application has been stopped with the following *curl* command or by opening the URL in your web browser:

	curl http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/health_check.php
	
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
	<html><head>
	<title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title>
	</head><body>
	<h1>Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1>
	<p>The server is temporarily unable to service your
	request due to maintenance downtime or capacity
	problems. Please try again later.</p>
	<hr>
	<address>Apache/2.2.15 (Red Hat) Server at myfirstapp-ose.example.com Port 80</address>
	</body></html>


To start the application back up, execute the following command:

	rhc app start firstphp

	RESULT:
	firstphp started

Verify that your application has been started with the following *curl* command:

	curl http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/health
	
	1
	

You can also stop and start the application in one command, as shown below:

	rhc app restart firstphp

	RESULT:
	firstphp restarted


##**Viewing application details**

All of the details about an application can be viewed by the *rhc app show* command. This command will list when the application was created, the unique identifier of the application, Git URL, SSH URL, and other details, as shown below:


	rhc app show firstphp
	firstphp @ http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/ (uuid: 52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070)
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Created:    Dec 16  9:49 PM
	  Gears:      1 (defaults to small)
	  Git URL:    ssh://52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	  SSH:        52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Deployment: auto (on git push)

	  php-5.3 (PHP 5.3)
	  -----------------
	  Gears: 1 small



##**Viewing application status**

The state of application gears can be viewed by passing the `--state` switch to the *rhc app show* command, as shown below:

	rhc app show --state firstphp
	Password: ****
	
	
	RESULT:
	Cartridge php-5.3 is started


##**Cleaning up an application**

As a user starts developing an application and deploying changes to OpenShift Enterprise, the application will start consuming some of the available disk space that is part of their quota. This space is consumed by the Git repository, log files, temporary files, and unused application libraries. OpenShift Enterprise provides a disk-space cleanup tool to help users manage the application disk space. This command is also available under *rhc app* and performs the following functions:

* Runs the *git gc* command on the application's remote Git repository.
* Clears the application's */tmp/* and log file directories. These are specified by the application's *OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR* and *OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR* environment variables.
* Clears unused application libraries. This means that any library files previously installed by a *git push* command are removed.

To clean up the disk space on your application gear, run the following command:

	rhc app tidy firstphp

After running this command you should see the following output:

##**Connecting to application gear with SSH**

OpenShift allows remote access to the application gear by using the Secure Shell protocol (SSH). [Secure Shell (SSH)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a network protocol for securely getting access to a remote computer.  SSH uses RSA public key cryptography for both the connection and authentication. SSH provides direct access to the command line of your application gear on the remote server. After you are logged in on the remote server, you can use the command line to directly manage the server, check logs, and test quick changes. OpenShift Enterprise uses SSH for the following:

* Performing Git operations.
* Remote access your application gear.

The SSH keys were generated and uploaded to OpenShift Enterprise by *rhc setup* command we executed in a previous lab. You can verify that SSH keys are uploaded by logging into the OpenShift Enterprise management console and clicking on the *Settings* tab, as shown below.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/sshKeys-webconsole.png)

**Note:** If you don't see an entry under *Public Keys*, then you can either upload the SSH key by clicking on *Add a new key* or run the *rhc setup* command again. This will create a SSH key pair in the `.ssh/` folder in the user's home directory and upload the public key to the OpenShift Enterprise server.

After the SSH keys are uploaded, you can SSH into the application gear, as shown below.  SSH is installed by default on most UNIX-like platforms, such as Mac OSX and Linux.  For Windows, you can use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).  Instructions for installing PuTTY can be found [on the OpenShift website](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/page/install-and-setup-putty-ssh-client-for-windows). 

Although you can SSH in by using the standard *ssh* command line utility, the *rhc* tool includes an SSH command that makes the process of logging in to your application even easier.  To SSH to your gear, execute the following command:

	rhc app ssh firstphp


If you want to use the *ssh* command-line utility, execute the following command:


	ssh UUID@appname-namespace.apps.example.com

You can get the SSH URL by running *rhc app show* command, as shown below:

	rhc app show firstphp
	firstphp @ http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/ (uuid: 52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070)
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  Domain:     ose

##**Viewing log files for an application**

Logs are very important when you want to find out why an error is happening or if you want to check the health of your application. OpenShift Enterprise provides the *rhc tail* command to display the contents of your log files. To view all the options available for the *rhc tail* command, issue the following:

	rhc tail -h
	Usage: rhc tail <application>

	Tail the logs of an application


	Options
	  -n, --namespace NAME      Name of a domain
	  -o, --opts options        Options to pass to the server-side (linux based) tail command (applicable to tail command only) (-f is implicit.  See the linux tail man page full list of options.) (Ex: --opts '-n
	                            100')
	  -f, --files files         File glob relative to app (default <application_name>/logs/*) (optional)
	  -g, --gear ID             Tail only a specific gear
	  -a, --app NAME            Name of an application

	Global Options
	  -l, --rhlogin LOGIN       OpenShift login
	  -p, --password PASSWORD   OpenShift password
	  --token TOKEN             An authorization token for accessing your account.
	  --server NAME             An OpenShift server hostname (default: openshift.redhat.com)
	  --timeout SECONDS         The timeout for operations

	  See 'rhc help options' for a full list of global options.


The *rhc tail* command requires that you provide the name of the application with the logs you would like to view.  To view the log files of our *firstphp* application, use the following command:

	rhc tail firstphp

You should see information for both the access and error logs.  While you have the *rhc tail* command running, issue a HTTP *GET* request by pointing your web browser to *http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com*.  You should see a new entry in the log files that looks similar to this:

	10.10.56.204 - - [22/Jan/2013:18:39:27 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 5242 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0"

The log files are also available on the gear node host in the *php-5.3/logs/* directory.

Now that you know how to view log files by using the *rhc tail* command, it is also important to know how to view logs during an SSH session on the gear.  SSH into the gear and use the knowledge you have learned in the lab to tail the logs files on the gear.

##**Viewing disk quota for an application**

In a previous lab, we configured the application gears to have a disk-usage quota.  You can view the quota of your currently running gear by connecting to the gear node host via SSH as discussed previously in this lab.  Once you are connected to your application gear, enter the following command:

	quota -s

If the quota information that we configured earlier is correct, you should see the following information:

	Disk quotas for user e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d (uid 1000): 
	     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
	/dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root
	                  22540       0   1024M             338       0   40000        

To view how much disk space your gear is actually using, you can also enter in the following:

	du -h

##**Adding a custom domain to an application using the command line**

OpenShift Enterprise supports the use of custom domain names for an application.  For example, suppose we want to use http://www.somesupercooldomain.com for the application *firstphp* that we created in a previous lab. The first thing you need to do before setting up a custom domain name is to buy the domain name from domain registration provider.

After buying the domain name, you have to add a [CNAME record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) for the custom domain name.  Once you have created the CNAME record, you can let OpenShift Enterprise know about the CNAME by using the *rhc alias* command:

	rhc alias add firstphp www.mycustomdomainname.com

Technically, what OpenShift Enterprise has done under the hood is set up a Vhost in Apache to handle the custom URL.

##**Adding a custom domain to an application using the management console**

The OpenShift management console allows you to configure a custom domain for your application without using the command-line tools.  Point your browser to *broker.hosts.example.com* and authenticate.  After you have authenticated to the management console, click on the *Applications* tab at the top of the screen.

You should see the *firstphp* application listed:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/domainName.png)

Click on the *change* link next to your application name.  On the following page, you can specify the custom domain name for your application.  Go ahead and add a custom domain name of *www.openshiftrocks.com* and click the save button.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/customDomainName.png)

You should now see the new domain name listed in the console.  You can also verify the alias was added by running the following command at your terminal prompt:

	rhc app show firstphp

If the alias was added correctly, you should see the following output:

	firstphp @ http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/ (uuid: 52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070)
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Created:    Dec 16  9:49 PM
	  Gears:      1 (defaults to small)
	  Git URL:    ssh://52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	  SSH:        52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Deployment: auto (on git push)
	  Aliases:    www.openshiftrocks.com

	  php-5.3 (PHP 5.3)
	  -----------------
	    Gears: 1 small


If you point your web browser to www.openshiftrocks.com, you will notice that it does not work.  This is because the domain name has not been setup with a DNS registry.  In order to verify that the vhost was added, add an entry in your */etc/hosts* file on your local machine.

	sudo vi /etc/hosts

Add the following entry:

	172.16.1.3  www.openshiftrocks.com

Once you have edited and saved the file, open your browser and go to your custom domain name.  You should see the application.

Once you have verified that the vhost was added correctly by viewing the site in your web browser, delete the line from the */etc/hosts* file.

##**Backing up an application**

Use the *rhc snapshot save* command to create backups of your OpenShift Enterprise application. This command creates a gzipped tar file of your application and of any locally-created log and data files.  This snapshot is downloaded to your local machine.  The directory structure that exists on the server is maintained in the downloaded archive.

	rhc snapshot save firstphp
	Password: ****
	
	Pulling down a snapshot to firstphp.tar.gz...
	Waiting for stop to finish
	Done
	Creating and sending tar.gz
	Done
	
	RESULT:
	Success

After the command successfully finishes, you will see a file named *firstphp.tar.gz* in the directory where you executed the command. The default filename for the snapshot is *[Application_Name].tar.gz*. You can override this path and filename with the `-f` or `--filepath` option.

**NOTE**: This command will stop your application for the duration of the backup process.

Now that we have our application snapshot saved, edit the *index.php* file in your *firstphp* application and change the *Welcome to OpenShift Enterprise* `<h1>` tag to say *Welcome to OpenShift Enterprise before restore*.

Once you have made this change, perform the following commands to push your changes to your application gear:

	git commit -am "Added message"
	git push

Verify that changes are reflected in your web browser.

##**Restoring a backup**

Not only can you take a backup of an application, but you can also restore a previously saved snapshot.  This form of the *rhc* command restores the Git repository, as well as the application data directories and the log files found in the specified archive. When the restoration is complete, OpenShift Enterprise runs the deployment script on the newly restored repository.  To restore an application snapshot, run the following command:

	rhc snapshot restore firstphp -f firstphp.tar.gz

You will see the following confirmation message:

	Restoring from snapshot firstphp.tar.gz...
	Removing old data dir: ~/app-root/data/*
	Restoring ~/app-root/data

	RESULT:
	Success


**NOTE**: This command will stop your application for the duration of the restore process.

Open up a web browser and point to the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com

If the restore process worked correctly, you should see the restored application running just as it was before.


##**Deleting an application**

You can delete an OpenShift Enterprise application by executing the *rhc app delete* command. This command deletes your application and all of its data on the OpenShift Enterprise server but leaves your local directory intact. This operation cannot be undone, so use it with caution. 

	rhc app delete someAppToDelete
	
	Are you sure you wish to delete the 'someAppToDelete' application? (yes/no)
	yes 
	
	Deleting application 'someAppToDelete'
	
	RESULT:
	Application 'someAppToDelete' successfully deleted

There is another variant of this command which does not require the user to confirm the delete operation.  To use this variant, pass the `--confirm` flag.

	rhc app delete --confirm someAppToDelete
	
	Deleting application 'someAppToDelete'
	
	RESULT:
	Application 'someAppToDelete' successfully deleted


##**Viewing a thread dump of an application**

**Note:** This section requires a Ruby or JBoss application type.  Since we have not created one yet in this class, read through the material below but don't actually perform the commands at this time.

You can trigger a thread dump for Ruby and JBoss applications using the *rhc threaddump* command. A thread dump is a snapshot of the state of all threads that are part of the runtime process.  If an application appears to have stalled or is running out of resources, a thread dump can help reveal the state of the runtime, identify what might be causing any issues, and ultimately help resolve the problem. To trigger a thread dump, execute the following command:

	rhc threaddump ApplicationName

After running this command for a JBoss or Ruby application, you will be given a log file that you can view in order to see the details of the thread dump.  Issue the following command, substituting the correct log file:

	rhc tail ApplicationName -f ruby-1.9/logs/error_log-20130104-000000-EST -o '-n 250'

#**Lab 9: Using cartridges**

**Server used:**

* client host
* node host

**Tools used:**

* *rhc*
* *mysql*
* *tail*
* *git*
* PHP

Cartridges provide the actual functionality necessary to run applications. There are several cartridges available to support different programming languages, databases, monitoring, and management. Cartridges are designed to be extensible so the community can add support for any programming language, database, or management tool not officially supported by OpenShift Enterprise. Please refer to [the documentation for how you can write your own cartridge](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/introduction-to-cartridge-building).

	https://www.openshift.com/wiki/introduction-to-cartridge-building

##**Viewing available cartridges**

To view all of the available commands for working with cartridges on OpenShift Enterprise, enter the following command:

	rhc cartridge -h

To see a list of all available cartridges to users of this OpenShift Enterprise deployment, issue the following command:

	rhc cartridge list

You should see the following output depending on which cartridges you have installed:

	jbosseap-6       JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 web
	jenkins-1        Jenkins Server                              web

	haproxy-1.4      Web Load Balancer                           addon

Note: Web cartridges can only be added to new applications.


##**Adding the MySQL cartridge**

In order to use a cartridge, we need to embed it into our existing application.  OpenShift Enterprise provides support for version 5.1 of the popular MySQL open source database.  To enable MySQL support for the *firstphp* application, issue the following command:

	rhc cartridge add mysql-5.1 -a firstphp
	
	You should see the following output:

	Adding mysql-5.1 to application 'firstphp' ... done

	mysql-5.1 (MySQL 5.1)
	---------------------
	  Gears:          Located with php-5.3
	  Connection URL: mysql://$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST:$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT/
	  Database Name:  firstphp
	  Password:       9svQXLVtv89Y
	  Username:       adminxzGaLVm

	MySQL 5.1 database added.  Please make note of these credentials:

	       Root User: adminxzGaLVm
	   Root Password: 9svQXLVtv89Y
	   Database Name: firstphp

	Connection URL: mysql://$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST:$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT/

##**Using MySQL**

Developers will typically interact with MySQL by using the *mysql* shell command on OpenShift Enterprise.  In order to use the *mysql* shell, use the information you gained in a previous lab in order to SSH to your application gear.  Once you have been authenticated, issue the following command:

	[firstphp-ose.example.com ~]\> mysql

You will notice that you did not have to authenticate to the MySQL database.  This is because OpenShift Enterprise sets environment variables that contain the connection information for the database.

When embedding the MySQL database, OpenShift Enterprise creates a default database based upon the application name.  That being said, the user has full permissions to create new databases inside of MySQL.  Let's use the default database that was created for us and create a *users* table:

	mysql> use firstphp;
	Database changed
	
	mysql> create table users (user_id int not null auto_increment, username varchar(200), PRIMARY KEY(user_id));
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

	mysql> insert into users values (null, 'gshipley@redhat.com');
	Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Verify that the user record has been added by selecting all rows from the *users* table:

	mysql> select * from users;
	+---------+---------------------+
	| user_id | username            |
	+---------+---------------------+
	|       1 | gshipley@redhat.com |
	+---------+---------------------+
	1 row in set (0.00 sec)

To exit out of the MySQL session, simply enter the *exit* command:

	mysql> exit

##**MySQL environment variables**

As mentioned earlier in this lab, OpenShift Enterprise creates environment variables that contain the connection information for your MySQL database.  If a user forgets their connection information, they can always retrieve the authentication information by viewing these environment variables:

**Note:  Execute the following on the application gear**

	[firstphp-ose.example.com ~]\> env |grep MYSQL

You should see the following information returned from the command:

	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DIR=/var/lib/openshift/52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070/mysql/
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT=3306
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST=127.10.134.130
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=9svQXLVtv89Y
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_IDENT=redhat:mysql:5.1:0.2.6
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=adminxzGaLVm
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_SOCKET=/var/lib/openshift/52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070/mysql//socket/mysql.sock
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_URL=mysql://adminxzGaLVm:9svQXLVtv89Y@127.10.134.130:3306/
	OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_LOG_DIR=/var/lib/openshift/52afd7bc3a0fb277cf000070/mysql//log/

To view a list of all *OPENSHIFT* environment variables, you can use the following command:

	[firstphp-ose.example.com ~]\> env | grep OPENSHIFT

##**Viewing MySQL logs**

Given the above information, you can see that the log file directory for MySQL is specified with the *OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_LOG_DIR* environment variable.  To view these log files, simply use the tail command:

	[firstphp-ose.example.com ~]\> tail -f $OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_LOG_DIR/*

##**Connecting to the MySQL cartridge from PHP**

Now that we have verified that our MySQL database has been created correctly, and have created a database table with some user information, let's connect to the database from PHP in order to verify that our application code can communicate to the newly embedded MySQL cartridge.  Create a new file named *dbtest.php* in the *php/* directory of your *firstphp* application.  Add the following source code to the *dbtest.php* file:


	<?php
	$dbhost = getenv("OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST");
	$dbport = getenv("OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT");
	$dbuser = getenv("OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME");
	$dbpwd = getenv("OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD");
	$dbname = getenv("OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME");
	
	$connection = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpwd);
	
	if (!$connection) {
	        echo "Could not connect to database";
	} else {
	        echo "Connected to database.<br>";
	}
	
	$dbconnection = mysql_select_db($dbname);
	
	$query = "SELECT * from users";
	
	$rs = mysql_query($query);
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($rs)) {
	    echo $row['user_id'] . " " . $row['username'] . "\n";
	}
	
	mysql_close();
	
	?>

Once you have created the source file, add the file to your Git repository, commit the change, and push the change to your OpenShift Enterprise gear:

	git add .
	git commit -am "Adding dbtest.php"
	git push

After the code has been deployed to your application gear, open up a web browser and enter the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/dbtest.php

You should see a screen with the following information:

	Connected to database.
	1 gshipley@redhat.com 


##**Managing cartridges**

OpenShift Enterprise provides the ability to embed multiple cartridges in an application.  For instance, even though we are using MySQL for our *firstphp* application, we could also embed the cron cartridge as well.  It may be useful to stop, restart, or check the status of a cartridge.  To check the status of our MySQL database, use the following command:

	rhc cartridge-status mysql -a firstphp

To stop the cartridge, enter the following command:

	rhc cartridge-stop mysql -a firstphp

Verify that the MySQL database has been stopped by either checking the status again or viewing the following URL in your browser:

	http://firstphp-ose.example.com/dbtest.php

You should see the following message returned to your browser:

	Could not connect to database

Start the database back up using the *cartridge-start* command:

	rhc cartridge-start mysql -a firstphp


Verify that the database has been restarted by opening up a web browser and entering in the following URL:

	http://firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/dbtest.php

You should see a screen with the following information:

	Connected to database.
	1 gshipley@redhat.com 

OpenShift Enterprise also provides the ability to list important information about a cartridge by using the *cartridge-show* command.  For example, if a user has forgotten their MySQL connection information, they can display this information with the following command:

	rhc cartridge-show mysql -a firstphp

The user will then be presented with the following output:

	Password: ****

	mysql-5.1 (MySQL 5.1)
	---------------------
	  Gears:          Located with php-5.3
	  Connection URL: mysql://$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST:$OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT/
	  Database Name:  firstphp
	  Password:       9svQXLVtv89Y
	  Username:       adminxzGaLVm

##**Using port forwarding**

At this point, you may have noticed that the database cartridge is only accessible via a 127.x.x.x private address.  This ensures that only the application gear can communicate with the database.

With OpenShift Enterprise port-forwarding, developers can connect to remote services with local client tools.  This allows the developer to focus on code without having to worry about the details of configuring complicated firewall rules or SSH tunnels. To connect to the MySQL database running on our OpenShift Enterprise gear, you have to first forward all the ports to your local machine. This can be done using the *rhc port-forward* command.  This command is a wrapper that configures SSH port forwarding. Once the command is executed, you should see a list of services that are being forwarded and the associated IP address and port to use for connections, as shown below:

	rhc port-forward firstphp
	
	To connect to a service running on OpenShift, use the Local address

	Service Local               OpenShift
	------- -------------- ---- -------------------
	httpd   127.0.0.1:8080  =>  127.10.134.129:8080
	mysql   127.0.0.1:3307  =>  127.10.134.130:3306

	Press CTRL-C to terminate port forwarding

In the above snippet, you can see that the MySQL database, which we added to the *firstphp* gear, is forwarded to our local machine. If you open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser, you will see the application.

Now that you have your services forward, you can connect to them using local client tools. To connect to the MySQL database running on the OpenShift Enterprise gear, run the *mysql* command as shown below:

	mysql -uadmin -p -h 127.0.0.1

**Note:** The above command assumes that you have the MySQL client installed locally.

##**Enabling *hot_deploy***

If you are familiar with PHP, you will probably be wondering why we stop and start Apache on each code deployment.  Fortunately, we provide a way for developers to signal to OpenShift Enterprise that they do not want to restart the application runtime for each deployment.  This is accomplished by creating a *hot_deploy* marker in the correct directory.  Change to your application root directory, for example *~/code/ose/firstphp/*, and issue the following commands:

	touch .openshift/markers/hot_deploy
	git add .
	git commit -am "Adding hot_deploy marker"
	git push

Pay attention to the output:

	Counting objects: 7, done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 403 bytes, done.
	Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
	remote: restart_on_add=false
	remote: Will add new hot deploy marker
	remote: App will not be stopped due to presence of hot_deploy marker
	remote: restart_on_add=false
	remote: ~/git/firstphp.git ~/git/firstphp.git
	remote: ~/git/firstphp.git
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/pre_build
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/build
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/deploy
	remote: hot_deploy_added=false
	remote: App will not be started due to presence of hot_deploy marker
	remote: Running .openshift/action_hooks/post_deploy
	To ssh://e9e92282a16b49e7b78d69822ac53e1d@firstphp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/firstphp.git/
	   4fbda99..fdbd056  master -> master


The two lines of importance are:

	remote: Will add new hot deploy marker
	remote: App will not be stopped due to presence of hot_deploy marker

Adding a *hot_deploy* marker will significantly increase the speed of application deployments while developing an application.

#**Lab 10: Using the management console to create applications**


**Server used:**

* client host

**Tools used:**

* OpenShift Enterprise Management Console
* *git*

OpenShift Enterprise provides users with multiple ways to create and manage applications.  The platform provides command line tools, IDE integration, REST APIs, and a web-based management console.  During this lab, we will explore the creation and management of application using the management console.

##**Authenticating to the management console**

Open your favorite web browser and go to the following URL:

    http://broker.hosts.example.com

Once you enter the above URL, you will be asked to authenticate using basic auth.  For this training class, you can use the *demo* account that has been provided for you.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/images/consoleAuth.png)

After entering in valid credentials (*demo*/*changeme*), you will see the OpenShift Enterprise management console dashboard:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/webconsole.png)

##**Creating a new application**

In order to create a new application using the management console, click on the *Add Application* button.  You will then be presented with a list of available runtimes that you can choose from.  To follow along with our PHP examples above, let's create a new PHP application and name it *phptwo*:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.png)

After selecting to create a new PHP application, specify the name of your application:


![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.1.png)

Once you have created the application, you will see a confirmation screen with some important information:

* Git repository URL.
* Instructions for making code changes.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.2.png)


Open up a command prompt and clone your application repository with the instructions provided on the management console.  When executing the *git clone* command, a new directory will be created in your current working directory.  Once you have a local copy of your application, make a small code change to the *index.php* and push your changes to your OpenShift Enterprise gear.

Once you have made a code change, view your application in a web browser to ensure that the code was deployed correctly to your server.

##**Adding a cartridge with the management console**

Click on the *My Applications* tab at the top of the screen and then select the *phptwo* application by clicking on it.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.3.png)

After clicking on the *phptwo* application link, you will be presented with the management dashboard for that application.  On this page, you can view the Git repository URL, add a cartridge, or delete the application.  We want to add the MySQL database to our application.  To do this, click on the *Add MySQL 5.1* link:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.4.png)

Once the MySQL database cartridge has been added to your application, the management console will display a confirmation screen which contains the connection information for your database:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/php2.6.png)

If you recall from a previous lab, the connection information is always available via environment variables on your OpenShift Enterprise gear.

Using information you learned in a previous lab, add a PHP file that tests the connection to the database.  You will need to modify the previously used PHP code block to display only whether the connection was successful, as we have not created a schema for this new database instance.

Once you have completed this lab and your application, *phptwo*, is connected to the database, raise your hand to show your instructor.

#**Lab 11: Using the admin console**


**Server used:**

* client host
* broker host

**Tools used:**

* OpenShift Enterprise Admin Console

OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 includes the first version of an Admin Console, which will allow an administrator to gain valuable insights into the usage of the platform.  Having this visibility will allow the administrator to perform capacity planning as well as view metrics of the platform as a whole.

**Note:** The current iteration of the Admin Console is set to read-only.

##**Enabling external access to the admin console**

The default location for the admin console is at the following URL:

    http://broker.hosts.example.com/admin-console

However, by default, the admin console is restricted so that it will not allow external traffic.  In order to enable access to the admin console, you will need to create an SSH tunnel to the broker host.

**Note:** Execute the following on the client host.

	ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 root@broker.hosts.example.com

The above command will establish a tunnel between localhost:8080 on the host where you run the command (the client host) and localhost:8080 on the remote host (the broker host).

##**System overview**

Open your favorite web browser and go to the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080/admin-console

**Note:** You must use *http* and not *https*, and you must use *localhost* rather than *broker.hosts.example.com*.

Once you enter the above URL, you will see the admin console *System Overview* dashboard.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole1.png)

On this page, you can see the information for the number of districts and nodes that you have deployed in your environment for each available gear type.  In our lab, you will only see a single district with small gears.  However, in a production deployment of OpenShift Enterprise 2.0, the administrator will be able to view information for all available gear types.

For reference, a production environment may look look like the following image:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole2.png)

##**Viewing gear profiles**

Click on a gear profile's *Details* link from the System Overview page to view more information about it. Each gear profile page provides the same summary for the respective gear profile as seen on the System Overview page and allows you to toggle between viewing the relevant districts or nodes. The *Districts* view shows all of the districts in that gear profile, and by default sorts by the fewest total gears remaining, or the most full districts. Each district displays a progress bar of the total gears and a link to view the nodes for that district.

The *Districts* view also displays a threshold indicator. The threshold is a configurable value for the target number of active gears available on a node. Each node for the district appears as either over (displayed in red) or under (displayed in green) the threshold. Each bar is slightly translucent to allow for multiple bars of the same type to show through. Therefore, if there is an intense red or green color, then several nodes are either over or under the threshold.

At any point in time, you can refresh the statistics collected by clicking the refresh button in the upper right-hand corner of the details page.

##**Viewing suggestions**

The admin console also provides a suggestion system that will make recommendations on the current deployment.  In order to view any suggestions, click on the *Suggestions* tab at the top of the screen.  During this training lab, our install is a fairly basic deployment with a minimal number of applications created and deployed on the platform.  Because of this, you may not see any suggestions offered from the console.

Any suggestions will also be displayed on the *System Overview* page on the right-hand side of the screen.

##**Searching for application entities**

The upper right section of every page of the Administration Console contains a search box, providing a quick way to find OpenShift Enterprise entities. Additionally, the dedicated *Search* page provides more information on the expected search queries for the different entities, such as Applications, Users, Gears, and Nodes.

The search does not intend to provide a list of possible matches; it is a quick access method that attempts to directly match the search query. Applications, User, Gear, and Node pages link to each other where possible. For example, a User page links to all of the user's applications, and vice versa.

Let's use the search feature to find the *firstphp* application that we created in a previous lab.  In the upper right-hand corner of the admin console, select application from the drop-down box and then enter in *firstphp* in the search field:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole3.png)

After clicking the search button, you will see the details for the application displayed in the main browser window, as shown below:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole4.png)

On this application-details page, you can view all of the information about the application, including the URL, any aliases assigned to the application, the Unix user id that was created for the gear, the domain, which node the gear resides on, and any cartridges that application is using.  You can drill down even further by clicking on any of the links presented on the application-details page.

##**Searching for user entities**

In the previous section, we searched for our application that we created as part of this training class.  We can also use the search functionality to view detailed information for a user of the platform.  Using the skills you learned in the previous section, search for the *demo* user.

You should see a detailed screen listing the applications the user has deployed.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole5.png)

##**Using data with external tools**

The Administration Console exposes OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 system data for use by external tools. In the current iteration of the Administration Console, you can retrieve the raw data from some of the application controllers in JSON format. This is not a long-term API however, and is likely to change in future releases. The Administration Console provides the following resources:

**Exposed data points**

* */admin-console/capacity/profiles.json* returns all profile summaries from the Admin Stats library (the same library used by the *oo-stats* command). Add the *?reload=1* parameter to ensure the data is current rather than cached.

* */admin-console/stats/gears_per_user.json* returns frequency data for gears owned by a user.

* */admin-console/stats/apps_per_domain.json* returns frequency data for applications belonging to a domain.

* */admin-console/stats/domains_per_user.json* returns frequency data for domains owned by a user.

To verify this, you can enter in the following URL in your web browser:

    http://localhost:8080/admin-console/capacity/profiles.json

You should see output similar to the following:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/adminconsole6.png)

Having these data points available in a consumable JSON format will allow administrators to use external tools to monitor the OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 environment.

#**Lab 12: Scaling an application**


**Server used:**

* client host
* node host

**Tools used:**

* *rhc*
* *ssh*
* *git*
* *touch*
* *pwd*

Application scaling enables your application to react to changes in HTTP traffic and automatically allocate the necessary resources to handle the current demand. The OpenShift Enterprise infrastructure monitors incoming web traffic and automatically adds additional gears to satisfy the demand your application is receiving.

##**How scaling works**

If you create a non-scaled application, the web cartridge occupies only a single gear, and all traffic is sent to that gear. When you create a scaled application, it can consume multiple gears: one for the high-availability proxy (HAProxy) itself, and one or more for your actual application. If you add other cartridges like PostgreSQL or MySQL to your application, they are installed on their own dedicated gears.

The HAProxy cartridge sits between your application and the network and routes web traffic to your web cartridges. When traffic increases, HAProxy notifies the OpenShift Enterprise servers that it needs additional capacity. OpenShift checks that you have a free gear (out of your max number of gears) and then creates another copy of your web cartridge on that new gear. The code in the Git repository is copied to each new gear, but the data directory begins empty. When the new cartridge copy starts, it will invoke your build hooks, and then HAProxy will begin routing web requests to it. If you push a code change to your web application, all of the running gears will get that update.

The algorithm for scaling up and scaling down is based on the number of concurrent requests to your application. OpenShift Enterprise allocates 10 connections per gear---if HAProxy sees that you're sustaining 90% of your peak capacity, it adds another gear. If your demand falls to 50% of your peak capacity for several minutes, HAProxy removes that gear. Simple!

Because each cartridge is "share-nothing," if you want to share data between web cartridges, you can use a database cartridge. Each of the gears created during scaling has access to the database and can read and write consistent data. As OpenShift Enterprise grows, we anticipate adding more capabilities like shared storage, scaled databases, and shared caching.

The OpenShift Enterprise management console shows you how many gears are currently being consumed by your application. We have lots of great things coming for web application scaling, so stay tuned.

##**Creating a scaled application**

In order to create a scaled application using the *rhc* command line tools, you need to specify the `-s` switch to the command.  Let's create a scaled PHP application with the following command:

	rhc app create scaledapp php-5.3 -s

After executing the above command, you should see output that indicates that scaling is enabled:

	Application Options
	-------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Cartridges: php-5.3
	  Gear Size:  default
	  Scaling:    yes

	Creating application 'scaledapp' ... done


	Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done

	Cloning into 'scaledapp'...

	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Warning: Permanently added 'scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
	Checking connectivity... done

	Your application 'scaledapp' is now available.

	  URL:        http://scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/
	  SSH to:     52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Git remote: ssh://52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/scaledapp.git/
	  Cloned to:  /Users/gshipley/code/ose/scaledapp

	Run 'rhc show-app scaledapp' for more details about your app.

Log in to the management console with your browser and click on the *scaledapp* application.  You will notice while looking at the gear details that it lists the number of gears that your application is currently using:

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/scaledApp.png)

##**Setting the scaling strategy**

OpenShift Enterprise allows users the ability to set the minimum and maximum numbers of gears that an application can use to handle increased HTTP traffic.  This scaling strategy is exposed via the management console.  While on the application details screen, click the *Scales 1 - 25* link to change the default scaling rules.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/scaledApp2.png)

Change this setting to scale to 5 gears and click the *Save* button.  Verify that the change is reflected in the management console by clicking on your application under the *Applications* tab.

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/scaledApp3.png)

##**Manual scaling**

There are often times when a developer will want to disable automatic scaling in order to manually control when a new gear is added to an application.  Some examples of when manual scaling may be preferred over automatic scaling could include the following:

* You are anticipating a certain load on your application and wish to scale it accordingly.
* You have a fixed set of resources for your application.

OpenShift Enterprise supports this workflow by allowing users to manually add and remove gears for an application.  The instructions below describe how to disable the automatic scaling feature. It is assumed you have already created your scaled application as detailed in this lab and are at the root level directory for the application.

From your locally cloned Git repository, create a *disable autoscaling* marker, as shown in the example below:

	touch .openshift/markers/disable_auto_scaling
	git add .
	git commit -am “remove automatic scaling”
	git push

To add a new gear to your application, SSH to your application gear with the following command, replacing the contents with the correct information for your application.  Alternatively, you can use the *rhc app ssh* command.

	ssh [AppUUID]@[AppName]-[DomainName].example.com

Once you have have been authenticated to your application gear, you can add a new gear with the following command:

	add-gear -a [AppName] -u [AppUUID] -n [DomainName]

In this lab, the application name is *scaledapp*, the application UUID is the username that you used to SSH to the node host, and the domain name is *ose*.  Given that information, your command should look similar to the following:

	[scaledapp-ose.example.com ~]\> add-gear -a scaledapp -u 1a6d471841d84e8aaf25222c4cdac278 -n ose

Verify that your new gear was added to the application by running the *rhc app show* command or by looking at the application details on the management console:

	rhc app show scaledapp

After executing this command, you should see the application is now using two gears:

	scaledapp @ http://scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/ (uuid: 52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030)
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Created:    1:45 PM
	  Gears:      2 (defaults to small)
	  Git URL:    ssh://52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/scaledapp.git/
	  SSH:        52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Deployment: auto (on git push)

	  php-5.3 (PHP 5.3)
	  -----------------
	    Scaling: x2 (minimum: 1, maximum: 5) on small gears

	  haproxy-1.4 (Web Load Balancer)
	  -------------------------------
	    Gears: Located with php-5.3

![](http://training.runcloudrun.com/ose2/scaledApp4.png)

Just as we scaled up with the *add-gear* command, we can manually scale down with the *remove-gear* command.  Remove the second gear from your application with the following command, making sure to substitute the correct application UUID:

	[scaledapp-ose.example.com ~]\> remove-gear -a scaledapp -u 1a6d471841d84e8aaf25222c4cdac278 -n ose

After removing the gear with the *remove-gear* command, verify that the application only contains one gear---HAProxy and a single runtime gear:

	 rhc app show scaledapp
	
	scaledapp @ http://scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/ (uuid: 52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030)
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  Domain:     ose
	  Created:    1:45 PM
	  Gears:      1 (defaults to small)
	  Git URL:    ssh://52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/~/git/scaledapp.git/
	  SSH:        52b209683a0fb2bc1d000030@scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com
	  Deployment: auto (on git push)

	  php-5.3 (PHP 5.3)
	  -----------------
	    Scaling: x1 (minimum: 1, maximum: 5) on small gears

	  haproxy-1.4 (Web Load Balancer)
	  -------------------------------
	    Gears: Located with php-5.3

##**Viewing HAProxy information**

OpenShift Enterprise provides a dashboard that will give users relevant information about the status of the HAProxy gear that is balancing and managing load between the application gears.  This dashboard provides visibility into metrics such as process id, uptime, system limits, current connections, and running tasks.  To view the HAProxy dashboard, open your web browser and enter the following URL:

	http://scaledapp-ose.apps.example.com/haproxy-status/
